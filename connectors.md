# Connectors on Rocktech ISG-502

After acquiring a second Rocktech ISG-502, I finally received one of the front-panel connectors that would have originally shipped with the device.

> ðŸ’¡ At the time of writing, Funduino offers the full ISG-502 case **including the board and GPIO connector** for around â‚¬5 â€” a steal considering the case alone normally sells for over â‚¬60.

## Front Panel Connectors
The ISG-502 front panel has **two pluggable connectors**:
- **GPIO header** â†’ 5-pin  
- **Serial header** â†’ 7-pin  

### GPIO
The GPIO connector included with my spare unit is marked `15EGTK-3.5`.  
This is a **push-in spring terminal** (orange release tabs) manufactured by **Gion Electronics**, a compatible clone of the **Phoenix Contact MC 1,5/â€¦-PT-3,5** series.

### Serial
To test interchangeability, I ordered a `15EDGK-3.5` connector from AliExpress.  
Itâ€™s a **screw-type** version instead of push-in, but shares the same **3.5 mm pitch** and should mate correctly with the ISG-502 header.  
Iâ€™ll update this section once verified.
